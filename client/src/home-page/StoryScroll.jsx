              <p>
                Morning Mist Coffee began as a journey shared by three friends with a deep love for coffee.
                After traveling through South America, exploring local farms and learning the art of roasting firsthand,
                we became inspired to bring that passion home. What started as a small roasting project soon grew into
                a full coffee house, where we could share the rich flavors and traditions we had discovered. Today,
                we continue to craft every roast with the same enthusiasm, bringing high-quality coffee to early risers
                and dedicated coffee lovers alike.

                Morning Mist Coffee was founded with a passion for exceptional coffee and expert roasting.

                ensuring a rich and aromatic experience in every cup. Our coffee house was created as a welcoming space
                for early risers, serving freshly brewed blends with the first light of morning.
