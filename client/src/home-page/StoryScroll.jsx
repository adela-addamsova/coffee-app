        <h2>Our story</h2>
        <p>
          Morning Mist Coffee began as a journey shared by three friends with a deep love for coffee.
          After traveling through South America, exploring local farms and learning the art of roasting firsthand,
          we became inspired to bring that passion home. What started as a small roasting project soon grew into
          a full coffee house, where we could share the rich flavors and traditions we had discovered. Today,
          we continue to craft every roast with the same enthusiasm, bringing high-quality coffee to early risers
          and dedicated coffee lovers alike.

          Morning Mist Coffee was founded with a passion for exceptional coffee and expert roasting.
          From our small-batch roastery, we carefully select and roast beans to highlight their natural flavors,
          ensuring a rich and aromatic experience in every cup. Our coffee house was created as a welcoming space
          for early risers, serving freshly brewed blends with the first light of morning.
